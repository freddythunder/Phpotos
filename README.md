# Phpotos
Easiest Peasiest PHP/XHR Photo Gallery

# I've normally in the past created my own image galleries througout the years and leared all the ups and downs,
# Eurekas and pitfalls, and everything else.  I've decided to make a photo gallery that can create thumbnails
# a file folder based structure, no database to worry about but still maintain some captions, but most importantly
# have a drag and drop, easy to upload admin panel that appears on any of the gallery pages.
# All of this in a pretty PHP class that can be called in just a line or two.
